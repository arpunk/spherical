defmodule Spherical do
  @moduledoc ~S"""
  Spherical geometry library

  Spherical implements types and functions for working with geometry
  at euclidean spaces.

  Spherical is divided in different modules:

    * `Spherical.R1` - Operates on ℝ¹
    * `Spherical.R2` - Operates on ℝ²
    * `Spherical.R3` - Operates on ℝ³
    * `Spherical.S1` - Operates on S¹
    * `Spherical.S2` - Operates on S²

defmodule Spherical.R1 do
  @moduledoc ~S"""
  Implements types and functions for working with geometry in ℝ¹.

  ℝ¹ encompases the one dimensional euclidean space.

end

defmodule Spherical.R2 do
  @moduledoc ~S"""
  Implements types and functions for working with geometry in ℝ².

  ℝ² encompases the bi-dimensional euclidean space.

defmodule Spherical.R3 do
  @moduledoc ~S"""
  Implements types and functions for working with geometry in ℝ³.

  ℝ³ encompases the three-dimensional euclidean space.
